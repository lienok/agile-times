Welcome to the Sample app for the Pluralsight Course [Building Beautiful Angular Apps with PrimeNG](https://app.pluralsight.com/courses/angular-apps-prime-ng).

The course was officially released on Thursday, Aug 24, 2017.

I'll keep this page updated with breaking changes as the course ages.


 
## Starter Kit

* A basic menu template routing to blank components
* Styling for the shell, but none of the component CSS - which you insert as you go
* Blank component code shells for you to insert code as you follow along 

Go for it!
